You must check the pull requests before you try to suggest something
You may check Projects to see if there is something you can contribute.
You should attempt to pick the coding style I have.
You should also try to pick something I agree with.

I will start making sure pylance at some point is ran on my code.
Anyway, Please Make Pull Requests that seem to fit, if you have an questions you can join my discord which is linked in my readme.
I will have a code check at some point.
You should use Pylance to make sure your code is clean and well
Or you can use
```bash
black -l120 .
``` formatted.
I will make a way to check it in the future.
Thank You,
JDJG
